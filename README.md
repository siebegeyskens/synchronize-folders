# Synchronize Folders

This program is designed to synchronize two folders: a source folder and a replica folder. The goal is to ensure that the replica folder maintains an identical copy of the content present in the source folder. This synchronization process is one-way, meaning changes in the source folder will be reflected in the replica folder, but not vice versa.

## Features

- One-way synchronization from source to replica folder.
- Periodic synchronization at user-defined intervals.
- Logging of file creation, copying, and removal operations to both console output and a specified log file.
- Command line arguments for specifying folder paths, synchronization interval, and log file path.
- Utilizes built-in and external libraries for efficient implementation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on the system.
